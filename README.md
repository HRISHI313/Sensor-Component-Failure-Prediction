# Sensor-Component-Failure-Prediction
In this project, we aim to predict failures in sensor components using machine learning techniques. Sensors play a crucial role in various industries, providing critical data for monitoring and control systems. The ability to predict sensor failures in advance can help prevent costly downtime and improve overall system reliability.
